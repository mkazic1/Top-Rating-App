# Top Rating App

## Description
The main goal of this application is to have the functionalities of displaying the top 10 rated TV shows and the top 10 movies, a search function for both, and a detailed view for individual items.\
This is a full frontend application developed using React and TypeScript.\
TheMovieDB API was used for fetching data.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you should first run:

## `npm install` then `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## IMPORTANT
Generate an API key on this page [https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/) or if you have a valid one use it as described down below.\
Make a new .env file on the root level of the project (same level as src, public folders etc). Inside the env file you should have your generated API key in the following format:\
`REACT_APP_API=PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`\
In case of need rerun the app with `npm start`.

## NOTES FOR REVIEWRS
The reason why I am writing this is because this project was developed as a part of testing process which had a 7 days deadline.
I'm leaving this "NOTES" section here as a reminder for developers and recruiters who will review my work.\
This application is not fully finished and the development will be continued after the review, because my time is out.\
Main thing that I didn't manage to finish was Redux. I have started setting it up what you will see in the code, but unfortunately didn't manage to finish it.
